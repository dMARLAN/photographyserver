I need you to implement the following design doc: $ARGUMENTS

- Step 1:
    - Read the design doc and then explore the code base and understand how it will fit into the existing code.
    - Make heavy use of subagents (Agent tool) here and tell them to ultrathink as hard as possible on their subtask.
    - Create TODOs to track each subtask described in the design doc make sure you order them appropriately

- Step 2:
    - For each subtask have a subagent implement the subtask
    - Tell the subagent to ultrathink about its task and give it the design doc as context. 
    - Tell the subagent to make heavy use of subagents to understand the relevant existing code.
